    'How do we teach kids about money when money is disappearing? It’s easy with Rocket Piggy. Rocket Piggy is part piggy bank, part chores chart, part math teacher. Kids mark their chores, receive an allowance and play math games on Piggy. Parents approve chores, pay allowance, and monitor their child’s math progress on their smartphone. Of course, Save, Spend and Share goals are a big part of learning about money. Rocket Piggy has them too.',
