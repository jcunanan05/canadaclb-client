Research demonstrates that even small amounts of education savings can set in motion a chain reaction of positive social and educational outcomes for a child and their family:

1. Youth with savings earmarked for their education are 50% more likely to participate in post-secondary education than those who have none.
2. For children as young as 11, their perception of whether college is financially possible influences their school-focused goals and the effort they put into their school work.
3. Children with education savings between $1 â€“ $499 are 3 times more likely to pursue postsecondary and 4 times more likely to graduate.
